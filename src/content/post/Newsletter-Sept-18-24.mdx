**City of Syracuse Vision Zero Meeting**

The City of Syracuse is having a meeting on Vision Zero. "SYRACUSE, N.Y. â€“ Syracuse Mayor Ben Walsh announced a Vision Zero public meeting to gather feedback and share information on the development of a draft Action Plan for the comprehensive traffic safety initiative. The meeting will be held on Monday, September 30, 2024, from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. with a brief presentation at 6 p.m. at the Salt City Market Community Room." **([The entire press release is attached.](/documents/2024_08_17_PRESS_RELEASE_Mayor_Walsh_Announces_Vision_Zero_Public_Meeting.docx))** 

I will be there at 6pm, and if there is public commenting reiterating part of the initial email that was sent out and updated stats from the survey and some stand-out comments (working on adding that first email to the site \- sorry newer people to the group I'm still getting the hang of newsletters). 

It would be nice if more people could be there representing cycling. 

\* As of tonight we hit 50 responses. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that would happen, it's really happening folks.   
*Do you feel safe biking in Syracuse?*

**Veo Scooters**

This week there was an article about the continuation of Veo scooters here ([CNYCentral](https://cnycentral.com/news/local/syracuse-officials-weigh-safety-ahead-of-vote-to-keep-veo-program)). It's looking like we might have a potential ally in City Council, "When it comes to anecdotal reports of Veo drivers ending up on sidewalks or weaving through traffic, Councilor Corey Williams said that the city needs to address its bike-friendly infrastructure. He said while he supports the Veo program, he believes the introduction of hundreds of electric bikes and scooters without improving and expanding upon existing bike lanes was shortsighted." 

I'm going to send an initial introduction email to Williams about the group, and the survey. 

Best,  
Edward C. Deaver, IV
